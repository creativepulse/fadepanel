== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= How do I start using this widget? =

The Fade Panel widget requires two images. The first one is visible as a regular image. When the user rolls the mouse over it, the second one fades in, on top of the first one.

Create an instance of this widget and set its source field to something similar to this:

<fadepanel img1="image1.jpg" img2="image2.jpg" height="200" />

Replace image1.jpg and image2.jpg with the file names of your images, and set the correct height. Make sure the images are in the folder set in the Image Prefix field.
